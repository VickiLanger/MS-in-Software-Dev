# MS-in-Software-Dev
This repo will have my coursework and projects from my MS in Software Dev degree

## Why are your sharing?

### What's in a software dev degree?

 - What should I learn first? 
 - What should I learn next? 
 - Okay, I know some stuff, what now? 
 - Are you self taught? 
 - Ever wonder what everyone was learning in school?

Did you answer “yes” to any, most, or all of these? Yep, me too. I started [learning to code](https://dev.to/vickilanger/i-ve-never-finished-a-learn-to-code-program-4il8) 2ish years ago. For over a year, I’ve been teaching code stuffs to kids and rewriting curriculum. This still hasn’t seemed to be enough to catch the eye of many interviewers.

I started thinking about going back to school. I was pretty interested in going to one school but they never responded to some questions I had. After a few more months of looking, I found the right fit, applied, and got accepted. Though I am choosing to go back to school, I wish it were more obvious what to learn and in what order.

I have seen a few places try to do this. The [developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) has done an awesome job laying out a learning path.

With as helpful as those charts are, it might still be helpful to see what a degree program includes. Expect another post for each class with a list of things learned and resources.
