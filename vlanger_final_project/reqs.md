[ ] 1 conditional (if)
[ ] 1 try block with an else condition

6. Your code must run successfully and do something interesting.

[ ] When submitting your project, include instructions for running the code and installing any approved 3rd party modules.
[ ] record your (3-to-5 minutes) presentation using
Kaltura, as described later in this document. It is important to remember that longer is not better and you will lose credit for not being succinct in your presentation

Information on Kaltura:
https://onlinecampus.bu.edu/bbcswebdav/courses/00cwr_odeelements/metcs/cs_Kaltura.htm

In addition to the presentation, you are required to submit the following through Blackboard in one zip file called <user>_final_project.zip:
[ ] One-page summary of what the program does and why it is useful
[ ] All source files: programs, classes and data
[ ] Instructions how to run your code and install any third-party modules
